# Madgraph 4 GPU

This repository contains code developed in the context of porting the [MadGraph5_aMC@NLO](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/) event generator software onto GPU hardware. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is able to generate code for various physics processes in different programming languages (Fortran, C, C++). The code generated in this repository is back-ported in "epochs" into the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO generator to allow it to also produce source code for those physics processes to run on GPU platforms.
