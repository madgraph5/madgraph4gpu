# MG5aMC eemumu gridpack

This directory contains a (modified) MG5aMC gridpack for ee to mumu.

It contains all relevant Fortran code including MadEvent and all relevant data files.

## MG5aMC version and installation (2021.03.09)

The gridpack was created from a MG5aMC 2.9.2 installation in
  /eos/home-a/avalassi/2021/MG5aMC/2.9.2/

This is based on the latest 2.9.2 tarball:
-  https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/2.0/2.9.x/+download/MG5_aMC_v2.9.2.tar.gz

It is complemented with the following patches for a few python3 bugs:
-  https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maddevelopers/mg5amcnlo/2.9.3/revision/307
-  https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maddevelopers/mg5amcnlo/2.9.3/revision/308
-  https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~maddevelopers/mg5amcnlo/2.9.3/revision/310

## Python version

Python 3.8 was used from /cvmfs using the [setupPython38.sh](./setupPython38.sh) script.

## EEMUMU gridpack creation

The EEMUMU gridpack was created as follows

```
cd /eos/home-a/avalassi/2021/MG5aMC/2.9.2/
\rm -rf _EEMUMU
cat << EOF >> _EEMUMU.mg
generate e+ e- > mu+ mu-
output _EEMUMU
launch
set gridpack True
set ebeam1 750
set ebeam2 750
set ptl -1
set etal -1
set drll -1
{ time python3.8 ./bin/mg5_aMC -l DEBUG _EEMUMU.mg ; } >& _EEMUMU_log.txt
```

The [_EEMUMU_log.txt](_EEMUMU_log.txt) logfile has been copied to this directory.

The cross section computed during gridpack creation, originally displayed in _EEMUMU/HTML/run_01/results.html, is the following:

| Graph | Cross-Section (pb) | Error | Events (K) | Unwgt | Luminosity (pb^-1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _EEMUMU/SubProcesses/P1_ll_ll | 0.046903 | 0.000144 | 28.02 | 1592.0 | 0 |

The breakdown for the two MadEvent channels is the following:

| Graph | Cross-Section (pb) | Error | Events (K) | Unwgt | Luminosity (pb^-1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [_EEMUMU/SubProcesses/P1_ll_ll/G1](_EEMUMU/run01_G1_log.txt) | 0.02333 | 0.000131 | 14.01 | 798.0 | 3.42e+04 |
| [_EEMUMU/SubProcesses/P1_ll_ll/G2](_EEMUMU/run01_G2_log.txt) | 0.02357 | 6.01e-05 | 14.01 | 794.0 | 3.37e+04 |

## EEMUMU gridpack unpacking

The EEMUMU gridpack was unpacked as follows in this directory, removing all libraries and binaries that can be rebuilt:
```
 ln -sf /eos/home-a/avalassi/2021/MG5aMC/2.9.2/ .
 mkdir eemumu
 cd eemumu
 cp -dpr ../2.9.2/_EEMUMU/run_01_gridpack.tar.gz .
 tar -xvzf run_01_gridpack.tar.gz 
 \rm run_01_gridpack.tar.gz 
 touch madevent/Events/.keepme
 \rm $(find . -name *.pyc)
 \rm madevent/Source/BIAS/dummy/*.o
 \rm madevent/lib/*.a
 \rm madevent/bin/madevent
 cd madevent/Source
 make clean
 cd -
```

## EEMUMU gridpack usage

First, rebuild 
```
 cd madevent/Source
 make
 cd ../SubProcesses/P1_ll_ll/
 make
 cd ../../..
```

Then generate 100 unweighted events
```
  ./run.sh 100 1
```
