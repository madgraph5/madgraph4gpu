The mg-cpp-clean tool is derived with minimal changes from coolCppClean.
This was a tool that had been developed around 2010-2015 for the COOL project.

This file has been adapted from that downloaded from
https://gitlab.cern.ch/lcgcool/cool/-/raw/master/src/config/cmt/coolCppClean.txt

===============================================================================

The tool does two things:

1. A first pass with uncrustify, tuned to do minimal changes initially.
Most settings are the default hardcoded settings, the others have been tuned
to make sure the result converges (the tool should not add spaces each time).

We can still build a few more rules in the future into uncrustify, such as 
'if()\n{' rather than 'if(){\n', or 'char* i' rather than 'char *i'. Other 
rules, like 'sort #includes alphabetically', are beyond the scope of this tool.

2. The second pass is a batch clean with emacs. It is based on the old LHCb 
emacs 'M-x clean' command, largely reflecting the well documented formatting 
conventions of LHCb. This only reindents the code (line by line, without 
touching the line splitting) and removes trailing whitespaces on each line.

The emacs pass is the last phase so that if you use emacs with these 
settings (or another editor with similar settings, like vim),
then every time you save you automatically have the right indentation.
In fact also uncrustify does some indentation, but most of it
is overwritten by the emacs phase, so no need to tune that too much.

The LHCb emacs have been modified to change the indentation of comments.
- Comments starting with two stars, /** ... */, are indented.
  These are meant to be used for multi-line class description comments, 
  where each comment line starts with one *.
- Comments starting with a single star, /* ... */, are not indented.
  These are meant to comment out areas of code and preserve code formatting,
- Real code enclosed between /* MGCPPCLEAN-NOINDENT-START */ and 
  /* MGCPPCLEAN-NOINDENT-END */ tags is not indented, i.e. is treated like
  a comment. This is useful to work around bugs of uncrustify or of this tool.

===============================================================================

Details for uncrustify.

This version of uncrustify is tuned to result in no large change
(eg no splitting of lines and realignments of if/else and for blocks),
but it already results in a few useful improvements, such as
- Remove spaces: 'void  f()' becomes 'void f()'
- Remove spaces: 'f();  // comment' becomes 'f(); // comment'
- Remove spaces: 'typedef a  b;' becomes 'typedef a b;'
- Remove spaces: 'static A  a;' becomes 'static A a;'
- Add spaces: 'class A: B' becomes 'class A : B'
- Add spaces: 'default: ...' becomes 'default : ...'
- Add spaces: 'if ( ... ){' becomes 'if ( ... ) {'
- Add spaces: 'catch( ... ){' becomes 'catch( ... ) {'
- Add spaces: '{/* noop */ }' becomes '{ /* noop */ }'
- Align all trailing comments to the code rather than to each other
- Force exactly one newline at the end of the file
- Force exactly one whitespace before trailing continuation characters "\"
I tuned the configuration file a few times until I tested that the process
converges to a stable results (a second run does not change the code!).
