The copyright and license notice above cover the CUDACPP code-generating plugin
of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (in the following "MG5aMC") software, and all code
generated using that plugin. These are collectively referred to as "this work"
or "the MG5aMC CUDACPP plugin and the code that it generates", or more simply
as "the MG5aMC CUDACPP plugin", in the following and throughout this work.

The MG5aMC CUDACPP plugin and the code that it generates are based on the
initial work on porting MG5aMC to GPUs using CUDA and on speeding up MG5aMC on
CPUs using vectorized C++ by three original authors from CERN and UCLouvain.
The full development team currently includes the following authors :
  Stephan Hageboeck (CERN)
  Olivier Mattelaer (Universite Catholique de Louvain, original author)
  Stefan Roiser (CERN, original author)
  Andrea Valassi (CERN, original author)
  Zenny Wettersten (CERN)
See https://github.com/madgraph5/madgraph4gpu for more details. For the full
list of authors and collaborators of this work, see the file "AUTHORS" in the
same directory as this "COPYRIGHT" file in the source code of the plugin.

The MG5aMC CUDACPP plugin and the code that it generates are derived from, and
are intended to be used in combination with, the MG5aMC software and the code
that it generates. The MG5aMC software is developed by the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO
development team and contributors, also known as the "MadTeam", who are the
owners of its copyright and have licensed it as specified in
