   * The namespace where the Bridge class is taken from.
   *
   * In the current implementation, two separate shared libraries are created for the GPU/CUDA and CPU/C++ implementations.
   * Actually, two shared libraries for GPU and CPU are created for each of the five SIMD implementations on CPUs (none, sse4, avx2, 512y, 512z).
   * A single fcreatebridge_ symbol is created in each library with the same name, connected to the appropriate Bridge on CPU or GPU.
   * The Fortran MadEvent code is always the same: the choice whether to use a CPU or GPU implementation is done by linking the appropriate library.
   * As the names of the two CPU/GPU libraries are the same in the five SIMD implementations, the choice of SIMD is done by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   *
   * In a future implementation, a single heterogeneous shared library may be created, with the same interface.
   * Using the same Fortran MadEvent code, linking to the hetrerogeneous library would allow access to both CPU and GPU implementations.
   * The specific heterogeneous configuration (how many GPUs, how many threads on each CPU, etc) could be loaded in CUDA/C++ from a data file.
