C All Fortran arrays for kokkos offload can hold up to NB_PAGE_MAX events 
C These arrays are allocated at compile time (NB_PAGE_MAX is a constant)
C      
C Of these, only NB_PAGE_LOOP events are used in Fortran loops (#455)
C The value of NB_PAGE_LOOP can be chosen at runtime
C (very large for KOKKOS/GPUs, smaller for C++/CPUs using SIMD)
